# TO-DO-LIST
A fully responsive 'TO-DO-LIST' app that stores the data in the database and allow us to delete multiple data from database. 
To build this app, I used a combination of technologies,including a database management system like MongoDB,a backend framework like Express and EJS template engine.The app allows users to add To-Do Tasks by filling in a form that requires the user to enter the Task,Category and Due Date.Once the user has entered the details and clicked the “ADD TASK” button,it saves the data to the MongoDB database.We can observe the tasks that needed to be finished with deadline in MongoDB Compass.Once if the user has finished a specific task ,user can select the tasks and press “DELETE TASK”,then immediately the task will be deleted from the database.
